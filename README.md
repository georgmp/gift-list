### Overview

GiftList is an app where you can

  - notes/urls from anywhere
  - categories
- the app returns suggestions based on categories and/or events, or from Etsy's top lists if you do not specify categories or event

- you can save items from the suggestion list or from browsing all categories

## The brief

You must:

* Work in a team, using git to code collaboratively.
* Build a full-stack application by making your own backend and your own front-end
* Use an Express API to serve your data from a Mongo database
* Consume your API with a separate front-end built with React
* Be a complete product which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
* Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut
* Have a visually impressive design to kick your portfolio up a notch and have something to wow future clients & employers. ALLOW time for this.
* Be deployed online so it's publicly accessible.
* Have automated tests for _at least_ one RESTful resource on the back-end. Improve your employability by demonstrating a good understanding of testing principals.
